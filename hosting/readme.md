I'd love to run this workshop for you!

Demo making is a great way for people to express their creativity, and TIC-80 is a safe and fun environment to play with.

The workshop has proven suitable for anyone who has done a little bit of programming before, and also for those who are experienced but would like to get started in creative coding, or learn a new platform for doing so.
