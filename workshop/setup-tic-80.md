# Setup TIC-80

## Running TIC-80

The best way to run TIC-80 is to download it to your computer. If this is not possible, or there are issues running it, then you can alternatively try the Online Playground.

### Download to your Computer

You can download TIC-80 from the website. Visit the [Create page on tic80.com](https://tic80.com/create) and scroll down below the embedded editor to the 'Download' section. There are pre-built versions for the major platforms. After you've installed TIC-80, you might need to give it additional permissions to run.

The code is available to compile for yourself if you're keen to get dirty!

If you like TIC-80, I'd recommend buying the Pro version. This has a few extra features, such as being able to use an external code editor - but it also supports the developer, encouraging them to continue to make it better.

### Online Playground

Visit the [Create page on tic80.com](https://tic80.com/create) and click on the embedded editor.

There are some limitations - you can't copy and paste from the editor (or at least, this might be restricted by whichever browser you're using). You also can't save your code.

## Configuring

### Switch Dev Mode on

Dev Mode defines what happens when you hit `ESC` to exit a running program.

If Dev Mode is off (the default) then when you hit `ESC` then you're taken to a menu. If you want to edit your code, you'll need to select 'Close Game' and then hit `ESC` again.

When Dev Mode is on, when you hit `ESC` it takes you directly back into the code editor, and that's where you'll mostly want to be.

So, we'll switch Dev Mode on:

- Run the program (Ctrl-R)
- Hit ESC to break program.
- Select `OPTIONS` in the menu, using `cursor up`, `cursor down` and `enter`.
- Move up to `DEV MODE` and hit `cursor right` to switch it on.
- Move down to `BACK` and select it with `enter`
- Press `Esc`

`Esc` will now flip you between the code editor and the command line. This is the best setup for development.
