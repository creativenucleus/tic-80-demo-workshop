## Documentation

The TIC-80 website has a [Learn page](https://tic80.com/learn) featuring an outline of all commands. For further detail, see the [wiki](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki), which is regularly updated.

## Sizecoding

If you're interested in making big effects in the smallest space:

[Nanogems](https://nanogems.demozoo.org/) showcases some of their favourites across a range of platforms, including TIC-80.

For variety/technical inspiration, I'd select:

- [Thrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU5EGLvFXd8) - So much going on, and a wonderful use of colour palette [256 bytes]
- [cthulhu128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-7qy--BEEQ) - A captivating dynamic effect. Just [128 bytes]!
- [Terrain Spotting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCWRuUw8zw) - Nicely balanced perspective and colour use [256 bytes]
- [House of Mojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5U-Sz1zN1s) - Well considered progression across a few effects combined [256 bytes]
- [Martian Madrigal](https://tic80.com/play?cart=3296) - One of mine. They just make me smile. Includes sound [256 bytes]
- [Sunset Cove Moods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNDYInToM7s) - Another of mine, with a gentle colour palette change [256 bytes]

Also see [Tiny Code Christmas](https://tcc.lovebyte.party/) for a brilliant set of short tutorials in TIC-80 and another fantasy console, [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

[The Sizecoding wiki](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/TIC-80) collects together some techniques.

## Livecoding

Some selected examples in [Demozoo's Livecoding section](https://livecode.demozoo.org/)

Look out for regular Byte Jams (see Field-FX in the community links below) and the competition version (timed/restricted length) Byte Battles in demo parties.

## Other

PS made a [general demoscene getting started doc](https://github.com/psenough/teach_yourself_demoscene_in_14_days). When you're a bit more embedded, they produce [monthly reports](https://www.youtube.com/@psenough) on the demoscene, featuring releases and demoparties.

## Sound

The workshop covered some starting points for visual effects. For sound, see the `music` and `sfx` calls [Under 'sound' in the API](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/API#sound). There is documenation for the [SFX Editor](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/SFX-Editor). The Music Editor (Tracker) generally doesn't have a great reputation, but some do get some brilliant things out of it. [PSEnough's Music editor intro tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9oAccwjeDA) is recommended, and there's an explanation and good guide to the effects modifiers in the [Music Editor documentation](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Music-Editor).

If you'd like to go low-level, and poke/peek stuff, check out the [Sound register documentation](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/RAM#sound-registers). [The code in this cart](https://tic80.com/play?cart=807) may help you pick it apart. This [music visualiser](https://tic80.com/play?cart=115) may also illuminate.

## Communities

There are many demoscene communities. I've found myself following a number of Discords, which have their own specialisms, but include overlapping groups of people.

- Field-FX
    A community that grew from a demo event at EMF Camp. Very friendly and welcoming, and a good starting point for newcomers.
    I recommend the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RuSxTNzhZS), and following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fx_field) and/or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@FieldFX).
    They also run Byte Jams (hour long streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fieldfxdemo) on most Monday evenings) and they have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@field-fx5751) channel featuring previous streams.
- [Lovebyte](https://lovebyte.party/)
    An annual online event for sizecoding, featuring many computer systems, from TIC-80 to obscure hardware from the 1980s
    I highly, highly recommend their [Tiny Code Christmas](https://tcc.lovebyte.party/) a series of gentle, but nicely progressive series of tutorials. These are oriented towards sizecoding, but also helpful for general demo tips. This was my entrypoint, and I've loved where it's gone. They also have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/pUS5kCJTzp) - also a very supportive community.
- [NOVA Demoparty](https://novaparty.org/)
    The UK's biggest in-person demoparty, down on the Devon coast, annually in June. Also very welcoming!
    They don't use their Twitter/Mastodon accounts currently, but do have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/rBJTXJBeq2).

## Archives

- [Demozoo](https://demozoo.org/) is a database of productions across the demoscene. They also have [Nanogems](https://nanogems.demozoo.org/) and [Livecode](https://livecode.demozoo.org/) archives.
- [PouÃ«t](https://www.pouet.net/) is a huge archive of productions and associated stuff. It can be a bit aggresive in places, but it's a great resource.
