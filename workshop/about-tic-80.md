# About TIC-80

TIC-80 is a ‘Fantasy Console’ - that's a program that pretends to be an entire self-contained videogames console, running within another computer.

It's a retro-style platform, with capabilities that make it look and sound like an early-90s system - somewhere around a Super Nintendo / Super Famicom, but with some additional tricks. It was primarily designed for people to make games on, but the accessibility and style of it make it attractive just to play with.

One thing to note is that TIC-80 has no CPU limit - it runs as fast as it is able to on the host computer. This means that it may run at different speeds in different contexts (e.g. on your computer, on the web, on someone else’s computer etc.). This lack of common baseline performance can cause some issues when sharing code - it moves TIC-80 a little towards being an art tool.

TIC-80's visual capabilities and default palette can give effects a tell-tale chunky/cartoon look - the default palette is very ‘The Simpsons’, but that limitation can be broken!
